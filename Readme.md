## Get Next Line

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line
ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
static variables.

## Prototype
```c
int	get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
```
## Compilation

Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx. which will be used
as the buffer size for the read calls in your get_next_line.

```c
gcc main.c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 ../get_next_line.c ../get_next_line_utils.c

./a.out files/test01_with_lines 
```

With Main

```c
cd test
gcc main.c  -g -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 ../get_next_line.c ../get_next_line_utils.c
```

### Points to understand in Get next Line

According to our LNG subject
"Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text
available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the EOF." 
Lets look the loop in the main:

```c
if (argc == 2)
{
	fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
	while ((ret = get_next_line(fd, &line)) > 0)
	{
		printf("[ MAIN while RET: %d] | A line has been read #%d => %s\n", ret, line_count, line);
		line_count++;
		free(line);
	}
	if (ret == -1)
		printf("-----------\n MAIN An error happened\n");
	else if (ret == 0)
		printf("-----------\n MAIN EOF has been reached\n");
	close(fd);
	}
```

Lets see this line to open the file:
```c
fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
```

The normal return value from open is a non-negative integer file descriptor. In the case of an error, a value of -1 is returned instead.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
```
**Input parameters:**
- int fd file descriptor is an integer and not a file pointer. The file descriptor for stdin is 0
- void *buf pointer to buffer to store characters read by the read function
- size_t count maximum number of characters to read

Note.: a character is equivalent to a 1 byte and a byte is made up of 8 bits therefore a character is made up of 8 bits (1 byte)

We can do something like this to read 20 bytes or 20 characters:
```c
char buffer[20];
read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, 20);
```

Note.: remember read() doesn't add '\0' to terminate to make it string (just gives raw buffer).

## Some Basic Concepts

In fact, the C language treats all file streams equally, although some of the file streams may come from a disk or tape drive, from a terminal, or even from a printer.

Additionally, in C, there are three file streams that are pre-opened for you:
- stdin: The standard input for reading.
- stdout: The standard output for writing.
- stderr:The standard error for writing error messages.


## Valgrind

Install
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y valgrind
```

Use
```bash
gcc main.c -g -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=1 ../get_next_line.c ../get_next_line_utils.c
valgrind --leak-check=yes ./a.out mp_test01_with_file

valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --show-reachable=yes --num-callers=20 --track-fds=yes ./a.out
```


## Debug with GUI
